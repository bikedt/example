		<p>A Dog Whisperer, Horse Whisperer or Animal Whisperer can not be taught or learned through schooling it is a gift that one is born with. We have the ability to connect, communicate and understand animals. The others components are to be able to read energy, eye and body movements from the dog(s) and to look at the the way the owner and dog(s) act with each other and the surroundings they are in to determine why the problems are occurring and then I can resolve it through understanding, healing and communicating to all involved.

Dogs develop behavioral problems because of a dysfunction within the pack. The pack consists of humans and dogs who live together. Dogs normally would live in a pack with just dogs but we like to own pets and then us humans become part of the pack. Every individual in the pack has a role but one has to be the pack leader. If the owner does not take the pack leader role the dog (s) will and this is where the problems start.

<br><br>What I do is to change the dynamic of the pack and place the owner as the pack leader from this most behavior problems can be resolved. Other behavioral problems take more then just being the pack leader to be resolved. It seems easy but it is not it takes a skilled Dog Whisperer to accomplish full integration of the pack.</p>
		<p><br>The giving of treats and rewards will not change aggression or the mental status of the dog. In a pack where a dog is the pack leader he does not give treats or rewards to his pack to correct the rest of the pack this is only what us humans have come up with to try to correct behavioral issues and dogs do not understand this. Rewards or treats are effective with obedience training since it is a repetitive response and reward system how ever it does not change behavioral problems. I do incorporate obedience training so the owner has control over their dog as far as sit and come which is very important. 

Not one of my methods harm the dogs nor do I use scare tactics to change them. I communicate with the dogs in a way they communicate and most are non verbal communications. I work with the dogs first then with the owners and the dogs the owners are present at all times unless I am dealing with a dangerous dog and I will explain when I talk to you why I do this. Usually I need 2 hours and most behavioral problems can be resolved as long as the owners and all involved continue with what I have instructed  them what to do and my methods are long term successes not just ones that last for a week or two. All training is done at the home and outside.
